# Infinite Stories

Infinite Stories is a web app generating text RPGs using OpenAI's GPT.

At the start of a new story, you will describe the world you want to roleplay in and the character you want to be.
Once that's done, GPT will describe your starting location and gear (if you didn't specify it in your character description) and you will be free to do anything you want.

This is a very simple idea but a very fun game to play, especially with GPT-4.

## Features
- Infinite RPG generation
- Skill & leveling system
- Dice base combat system
- Complexe enemies with strength & weaknesses to each skill (all generated by GPT)
- Dynamic illustrations generated by DALL-E for each message sent by GPT (unsure about this as things could get really ugly really fast)
- Full story, character & inventory persistence
- Support for GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 (you need to spend at least 1$ in the API to access GPT-4)

Do you want to be a dragon slayer ? Or maybe be a drug dealer in the darkest alley ways of Novigrad, or a legendary Hacker in 2169 ? With Infite Stories, you will be able to do it all, and even more.
